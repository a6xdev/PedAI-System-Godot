## Crowd AI in Godot Engine

Crowd AI is a crowd simulation system for NPCs made in Godot Engine.

The project objective is to have a realistic and optimized flow of NPCs in open worlds, with support for:
- Dynamic spawning based on player distance (with object pooling).
- Management by areas and pathnodes, allowing for reduced processing power.
- Group NPCs, with follow-the-leader and disperse behavior.
- Various actions (walking, sitting, leaning, etc.).
- Extensible: easy to add new types of behavior or states.

> [!WARNING]
> The project isn't completely finished; there are still some bugs, but it's quite consistent and can serve as a study if you want to do something similar.
> The FlowAI tool I worked on to help develop this project still needs a lot of improvement, so I won't provide a download link yet.
> But you can find it in the **plugin** folder of this repository.
